# java-cli-demos
This is a collection of simple Java classes that demonstrate several Java-based command-line parsing libraries. The libraries are listed here in the order in which they were covered on the "Inspired by Actual Events" blog (http://marxsoftware.blogspot.com/). Note that the ordered of the presented Java-based command line parsing libraries is not significant other than that it's the order the libraries were presented on the blog.
